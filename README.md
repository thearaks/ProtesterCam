## Introduction
The idea behind this project spawns from [this video of repubblica.it](https://video.repubblica.it/dossier/scandalo-lega/salvini-e-la-catena-di-montaggio-dei-selfie-e-il-ministro-che-scatta-ogni-foto/341864/342454) where the new anti-protester strategy of the italian Ministry of the Interior is explained: to avoid [criticisms](https://video.repubblica.it/edizione/bari/in-puglia-salvini-sorpreso-da-un-nuovo-selfie-beffa-non-siamo-piu-terroni-di-m/335167/335768) from fake fans that asks for selfies the politic grabs the phone from the owner and takes the picture only when he has verified that the person is not a threat.

This leads to a distorted perception of reality in which a politic has no dissention or opposition.
These biased contents are then spread through social media to put in place fanbase growth hacking strategies and to divert the audience attention from the real problems of a nation.
The result is a powerful -and very dangerous- message.

This apps wants to give back to the people the right to dissent and the ability to make use of the same strategies to fight this propaganda.
